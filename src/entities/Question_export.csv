"1","Should I use the specific Auto-GPT library mentioned in the chapter, or can I implement a custom solution using OpenAI's API directly?","You can use either approach. The Auto-GPT library provides a good foundation, but implementing with OpenAI's API directly will give you better understanding of the underlying concepts. I recommend starting with the library and then exploring custom implementation as an advanced exercise.","answered","[]","68aa09c5f1a50b0ecd67257f","2025-08-23T18:34:45.365000","2025-08-23T18:34:45.365000","68aa064a35402563e7b92f61","jesusalc@tuta.com",""
